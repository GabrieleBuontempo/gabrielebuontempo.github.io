I am Gabriele Buontempo, a PhD student in Economics at [LMU Munich](https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/).

My research interests are in macroeconomics. In particular, I study how the distributions of beliefs and expectations affect inflation dynamics as well as the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy. 

Below you can find a preview of my research as well as ressources for the courses I teach at LMU.

You can find my CV [here](https://google.com).

My email address is gabriele.buontempo[at]econ.lmu.de and my office at LMU is located at: Ludwigstr. 28 (RGB), Room 015.
