Hi! Welcome to my webpage

I am Gabriele Buontempo, a PhD student in Economics at [LMU Munich](https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/).

My research interests are in macroeconomic theory and empirics. In particular, I study how the distribution of beliefs and expectations affects business cycles, inflation dynamics, and the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy. 

Below you can find a preview of my research and resources for the courses I teach.

You can find my CV [here](.).
