# Hi! Welcome to my webpage  

<br>

I am Gabriele Buontempo, a PhD student in Economics at <a href="https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LMU Munich</a>.

My research interests are in **macroeconomic theory and empirics**. In particular, I study how the distribution of beliefs and expectations affects business cycles, inflation dynamics, and the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy. 

Below you can find a preview of my research and resources for the courses I teach.

You can find my CV [here](.).
